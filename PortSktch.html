                    Welcome to my portfolio where I will give you examples of the programming and skills i have aquired over the years.
                    I have been a mostly self-taught programmer for nearly 5 years now, however i have been tinkering with code for around 8 years.
                    I took my first programming class in college and decided that I wanted to me a programmer.
                    Since then programming has become my passion. My desire is that through this website you will see the skills I can bring to your company.

                I wonder how I could go about making these
                a moving preview of my projects. I wonder if
                i would have to make them videos first or if
                i could just do it as a slideshow.
